      <p>You may be asked if you want to erase all contents on the hard drive, then install Windows. We recommend you choose this option, as it also formats the hard drive to allow the Windows operating system to be installed. The computer may need to restart several times during the Windows install process. The restarts are normal and if prompted to restart, select the Yes option.</p>

  <p>When the install process is nearly complete, the Windows configuration option screens are shown. On these screens, you may be asked to select the time zone you live in, your preferred language, and the name of the account you use to access Windows. Select the appropriate options and enter the appropriate information on each configuration screen. After Windows is installed on the computer, you need to install the drivers and related software for the hardware in the computer. You can use the installation discs that came with the hardware, or you can download the drivers from the hardware manufacturer's website.</p>
